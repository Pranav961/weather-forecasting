# weather-forecasting

The process of forecasting what the weather will bring is a very complex process that draws from data that comes from many sources, as well as an array of analyses and weather models that are offered in an attempt to make sense of the onslaught of data. Many tools and instruments are used in this process, such as barometers, thermometers, weather balloons, and even deep-space satellites.
